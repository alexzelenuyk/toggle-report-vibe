- Duplicate descriptions are included only once (no count displayed)
- Pause duration shows total time between time entries for the day as a relative value (1.0 = 60 minutes, 0.5 = 30 minutes)
- Total hours is calculated as: end time - start time - pause duration
- Pause calculation is second-precise and rounds up to the nearest minute
- Only counts gaps between entries (not overlapping time)
- Values use period as decimal separator
- Times are rounded to minutes (no seconds displayed)
- The date picker starts weeks on Monday
