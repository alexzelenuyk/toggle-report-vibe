The easiest way to deploy this application is to use the "Deploy with Vercel" button above.

Alternatively, you can deploy it manually:

1. Fork this repository
2. Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Create a new project and import your forked repository
4. Deploy!

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment:

1. On push to the main branch or pull requests targeting main, the workflow:
   - Runs ESLint checks
   - Verifies TypeScript types
   - Executes tests
   - Builds the application

2. When changes are pushed to the main branch, the workflow also:
   - Deploys the application to Vercel production environment

To set up the Vercel deployment in GitHub Actions:

1. Link your project to Vercel on your local machine:
   ```bash
   # Link your project to Vercel (run this once in your project directory)
   npx vercel
   ```

2. Run the helper script to get the necessary configuration values:
   ```bash
   npm run vercel-config
   ```

3. Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel API token (create at https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Your Vercel organization ID (shown by the helper script)
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Your Vercel project ID (shown by the helper script)

4. GitHub Actions will now automatically deploy your project to Vercel when you push to main.

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexzelenuyk/toggle-report-vibe.git
   cd toggle-report-vibe
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

## Report Format

### CSV Format

The generated CSV file follows this format:

```
start_date,start_time,end_time,job_id,pause_duration,total_hours,description
2025-03-24,08:53,18:15,293378-220,0.75,8.50,API-2846: kafka; Client meeting; Documentation
```

### Excel Format

The Excel export uses the following column names:

| Date | StartTime | EndTime | JobCode | Break | TotalHours | Description |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|-------|------------|-------------|
| 2025-03-24 | 08:53 | 18:15 | 293378-220 | 0.75 | 8.50 | API-2846: kafka; Client meeting; Documentation |

- Entries are grouped by day
- Descriptions for the same day are combined with semicolon separators
- Duplicate descriptions are included only once (no count displayed)
- Pause duration shows total time between time entries for the day as a relative value (1.0 = 60 minutes, 0.5 = 30 minutes)
- Total hours is calculated as: end time - start time - pause duration
- Pause calculation is second-precise and rounds up to the nearest minute
- Only counts gaps between entries (not overlapping time)
- Values use period as decimal separator
- Times are rounded to minutes (no seconds displayed)
- The date picker starts weeks on Monday
